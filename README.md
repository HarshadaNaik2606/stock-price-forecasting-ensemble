# Stock-price-forecasting-ensemble
Predictive modelling framework for stock price forecasting integrating Linear Regression, LSTM networks, and stacking ensembles using Decision Tree and XGBoost. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model comparison, and performance evaluation using Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data.
# Predictive Modelling for Stock Price Forecasting  
**Integrating Linear and Deep Learning Approaches with Ensemble Techniques**

---

## 🧩 Summary  
This project develops a **hybrid predictive modelling framework** for stock price forecasting by integrating linear models and deep learning architectures within a **stacking ensemble structure**. Using **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** stock data, the study compares **Linear Regression** and **LSTM** models, optimizes them, and then combines their predictive strengths using **Decision Tree** and **XGBoost** meta-learners to achieve improved forecasting accuracy and robustness.
